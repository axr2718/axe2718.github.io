I'm a final year student at the University of Texas at Dallas where I study Computer Science.

My research interests are in neural network pruning, optimization, and explainability. I'm also interested in
multimodal NLP research for linguistics.

I'm currently working with Dr. Richard Golden, Head of the Cognitive Science Department at UT Dallas, 
at the COINS Lab on statistical methods for pruning dense neural networks using sensitivity-based pruning.

I'll occasionally upload my research publications, projects, and blogs.
