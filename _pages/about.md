I'm a final year student at the University of Texas at Dallas where I study Computer Science. I'm also looking to become a Ph.D. candidate.

My research interests are in neural network pruning, double descent, regularization, and optimization. I'm also interested in
multimodal NLP research for linguistics using Large Language Models.

I'll occasionally upload my research publications, projects, and blogs.

# Current Research

I'm currently working with Dr. Richard Golden, Head of the Cognitive Science Department at UT Dallas, 
at the COINS Lab on statistical methods for pruning dense neural networks using sensitivity-based pruning.
