![My Research Interests](/images/io.jpeg){: .align-right width="300px"}
📖 I'm a final year student at the University of Texas at Dallas pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I'm an aspiring Ph.D. candidate passionate about making AI more accessible through efficient and optimized architectures.

🕵🏼 My research interests lie at the intersection of neural network efficiency and theoretical understanding:
- Neural network pruning and optimization
- Double descent phenomenon in deep learning
- Superposition in large neural networks
- Topological data analysis in deep learning
- Few-shot learning and vision transformers

👨🏽‍💻 I'm particularly fascinated by how modifying parameter spaces impacts architecture performance and generalization. My work spans computer vision, topological machine learning, and multimodal architectures.

# Current Research

## 🎬 Audio-Visual Transformer Benchmarking
Working with [Dr. Yunhui Guo](https://yunhuiguo.github.io/) on developing rigorous benchmarks for multimodal transformers, with a focus on safety-critical applications like autonomous vehicles. Creating comprehensive evaluation frameworks using AudioSet, Kinetics, and VGGSound datasets. Currently developing novel architectures to better handle audio-visual fusion and improve performance on these benchmarks.

## 🎯 Few-Shot Learning Enhancement
Working with [Dr. Yunhui Guo](https://yunhuiguo.github.io/) on improving cross-domain few-shot learning through topological data analysis and transformer architectures. Currently developing tuned encoder for Betti vector implementations for enhanced classification tasks using the SwinV2 backbone. [Code](https://github.com/axr2718/TopoFewShot)

## 🎥 Human Identification in Videos
Collaborating with [Dr. Alice O'Toole](https://labs.utdallas.edu/facelab/) on enhancing human identification in video sequences using modified vision transformers, focusing on improving generalization and accuracy by using the SwinV2 transformer instead of the current leading ViT.

## 🧮 Statistical Pruning of Neural Networks
Working with Dr. [Richard Golden](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~golden/) at the [COINS Lab](https://labs.utdallas.edu/coinslab/) on developing novel pruning algorithms using sensitivity-based statistical methods. Lead developer of [StatPruneNet](https://github.com/coinslab/StatPruneNet/tree/main), a benchmark toolkit for evaluating statistical pruning algorithms.

# Previous Research
## 🔍 Topological Vision Transformers
Collaborated with Dr. Baris Coskunuzer's [Topological Machine Learning Group](https://sites.google.com/view/topo-ml) on integrating topological data analysis with vision transformers, in particular SwinV2 transformer. Developed a novel approach achieving 10% improvement in breast cancer detection compared to baseline models and over 20% compared to topological CNNs using cross-attention between topological data analysis transformer encoders.
