![My Research Interests](/images/io.jpeg){: .align-right width="300px"}
📖 I'm a final year student at the University of Texas at Dallas where I study Computer Science. I'm also looking to become a Ph.D. candidate.

🕵🏼 My research interests are in neural network pruning, double descent, superposition, regularization, and optimization. I'm also interested in
multimodal NLP research for linguistics using Large Language Models.

👨🏽‍💻 I'll occasionally upload my research publications, projects, and blogs.

# Current Research
## 🧮 Statistical Pruning of Parameter Redundant Neural Networks
I'm currently working with Dr. [Richard Golden](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~golden/), Head of the Cognitive Science Department at UT Dallas, 
at the [COINS Lab](https://labs.utdallas.edu/coinslab/) on statistical methods for pruning dense neural networks using sensitivity-based pruning.

I'm the lead developer of [StatPruneNet](https://github.com/coinslab/StatPruneNet/tree/main), a benchmark tool that will evaluate sensitivty-based pruning algorithms with statistical analysis.
